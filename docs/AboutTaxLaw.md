**Tax Payment and Compliance in Nigeria Under the Nigeria Tax Act 2025 and Nigeria Tax Administration Act 2025**

The Nigeria Tax Administration Act 2025 (NTAA) outlines procedures for registration, returns, assessments, payments, and enforcement, while the Nigeria Tax Act 2025 (NTA) specifies tax rates and calculations for personal income tax (PIT) and companies income tax (CIT). These laws became effective on January 1, 2026. All taxable persons must register with the relevant tax authority-Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS, formerly FIRS) for companies and non-residents, and State Internal Revenue Services (e.g., Lagos Internal Revenue Service or LIRS for Lagos residents) for individual PIT. A Taxpayer Identification Number (Tax ID or TIN) is mandatory for compliance. Non-compliance attracts penalties, such as ₦50,000 for failure to register (Section 100 NTAA) or ₦100,000 plus ₦10,000 monthly for late filings (Section 101 NTAA).

This guide focuses on individual salary earners, self-employed individuals (including freelancers), and small business owners. Freelancers are generally treated as self-employed unless incorporated. Small businesses may be sole proprietorships (PIT) or incorporated (CIT). Tax is self-assessed (Section 34 NTAA), with payments due upon filing or in installments. Allowable deductions (e.g., business expenses, 20% rent relief up to ₦500,000, pensions) reduce taxable income. VAT applies if turnover exceeds ₦50 million (7.5% rate).

Since you are in Lagos, this guide emphasizes LIRS processes. Use the LIRS e-Tax portal for PIT filings. For federal aspects (e.g., CIT), use NRS portals. Always verify with official sources, as systems may update.

**Individual Salary Earners (Employees under PAYE)**

Salary earners under Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) have taxes deducted by employers. This applies to resident individuals earning from employment (excluding federal military/police/foreign service, handled by NRS). If all income is from salary, minimal individual action is needed beyond verification.

**How Tax is Calculated and How Much to Pay**

- **Taxable Income**: Gross salary minus deductions/reliefs (e.g., pension contributions up to 25% of salary, National Housing Fund, rent relief).
- **Tax Rates** (Progressive PIT bands under NTA 2025):

| **Annual Income Bracket (₦)** | **Tax Rate (%)** |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 800,000 | 0   |
| 800,001 - 3,000,000 | 15  |
| 3,000,001 - 12,000,000 | 18  |
| 12,000,001 - 25,000,000 | 21  |
| 25,000,001 - 50,000,000 | 23  |
| Above 50,000,000 | 25  |

- **Example**: Annual salary ₦2,000,000 (after deductions): 0% on ₦800,000 + 15% on ₦1,200,000 = ₦180,000 tax.
- **VAT**: Not applicable unless additional business income.

**How Payment Works**

- Employers deduct PIT monthly and remit to LIRS by the 10th of the following month (Section 14 NTAA). No direct payment needed if only salary income.

**Compliance Information and Penalties**

- Obtain Tax ID upon employment (Section 4 NTAA); employers may assist.
- Verify monthly payslips for correct deductions.
- If additional income (e.g., rentals), declare in annual return.
- Penalties: Employer liable for non-deduction (40% of amount, Section 105 NTAA); individuals for non-filing if required (₦100,000 + ₦10,000/month, Section 101 NTAA).
- Obtain Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) for transactions (Section 72 NTAA).
